# GSI-ToF

System Requirements:
- Software to run ipynb files in Python 3 
- Tested on numpy 1.26.4 and scipy 1.14.1

How to run:
- Download ToF_analysis.ipynb and data (~ 1 min)
- Open ToF_analysis.ipynb, edit 'date', 'shot', 'nominalTime' and 'path' variables to select desired shot
- Run rest of code (~ 1 s)

Outputs:
- Figure showing pre-processed data
- Figure showing energy profiles of the pulse of interest and background pulses
- prints values and uncertainties for the calculated energy shift and broadening
- prints values and uncertainties for the normalized energy shift and broadening
